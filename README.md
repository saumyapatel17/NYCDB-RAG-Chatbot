# NYCDB RAG chatbot

The **NYCDB RAG chatbot** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based application that allows users to upload `.csv` documents and ask questions to gain insights. It integrates semantic search with language models to provide precise answers using only the uploaded content.

## Features

- **CSV Document Ingestion**: Supports `.csv` files for document upload.
- **Chunking and Vectorization**: Processes documents into meaningful chunks for efficient retrieval.
- **Semantic Search**: Retrieves the most relevant information based on the user's query.
- **Gradio Interface**: Interactive user interface for uploading files and querying.
- **Chat History**: Maintains a conversational flow for multiple questions.

## Ways to Improve Accuracy

1. **Query Expansion**: Broaden search terms to capture more relevant information.
2. **Improved Chunking**: Ensure documents are split meaningfully for better context retention.
3. **Enhanced Semantic Search**: Utilize advanced models like transformers for more precise retrieval.
4. **Re-ranking**: Prioritize search results based on relevance to the query.
5. **Post-processing of Responses**: Summarize and fact-check responses for clarity and accuracy.
6. **Feedback Loop**: Implement user feedback mechanisms to refine model responses over time.
